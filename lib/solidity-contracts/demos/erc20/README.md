# ERC20 Multi-VM Token Standard Demo

This demo shows how to deploy and interact with our `MintBurnBankERC20` contract,
which is backed entirely by native chain balances.

This demo goes through the following steps:

1) deploy `MintBurnBankERC20` contract
2) Mint 666 tokens
3) Query balances through x/bank and EVM JSON-RPC
4) Transfer 555 tokens
5) Query balances again
